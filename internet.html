        <p>a few years ago during my undergrad, i was working on a side project with a close friend of mine and fell down a wikipidia rabbithole (as i often do). from what i remember, the starting point was about the history of HTML and its role in the creation of the World Wide Web. somehow i found my way to this wikipidia page detailing the work and life of Eva Aariak; an Inuk politician and previous langugaes commissioner (which i didn't realize was a thing you could be). in this article, i was introduced to the Inuktitut word for internet, "ikiaqqivik", which literally translates to "travelling through layers." i turned to my friend and shared with them my findings, sparking a conversation about our internet travels that lasted throughout the night. we discussed the affective experience of being online and how that changed through our lives. we discussed what it felt like to be able to peel back the layers of the internet when learning how to code. we discussed how magical and transcendant being online felt. the following day i went back to that wikipidia page, took a screenshot, and saved it to my phone in an attempt to keep it close to my heart. i think this might be a better place to store it.</p>
