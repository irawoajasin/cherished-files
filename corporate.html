        <p>this past summer was the summer of the corporate gay. all of my creative friends who longed for careers of passion, intentionality, and fulfillment found themselves working as designers in stuffy corporate offices for the first time ever. our group chat was an enclave queer designers working within industry but always feeling like they didn't belong. from the clothing to the language to the very values that brought them into those rooms in the first place, we felt askew to the corporate normcore environment and expecations. this screenshot was a reminder, from me to the groupchat, of the humourous nature of these environemnts. that it was ok if we didn't fully fit in or understand the tech bro cultural aesthetic or understanding. but by bringing our full queer selves to the table, maybe we can just enjoy bringing a bit of color to the corporate grey.</p>
