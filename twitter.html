        <p>i have a love/hate relationship with twitter. i think every user on that platform has a love/hate relationship with it. when im not ranting about my frustrations regarding the platform or getting into (very) occassional twitter argument, i find it to be a place where i experience the most magical, connective moment on the internet. every piece of discourse is public, which allows you to have these ephemeral but very human interactions with other twitter dwellers on a regular basis. this screenshot came from a typical day scrolling through twitter and encountering this algorithmic moment of serendipity. a tweet about loving hot dogs followed by another about finally getting the desired hot dogs. it was beautiful how these tweets came together, complety out of their own knowledge. they settled together in my timeline like puzzle pieces, just for me. it felt like a moment of chance, of random symmetry. and it made me feel to strongly, that i captured a screenshot of it, and shared it to all of my friends.</p>
        <p>it feels dramatic but algorithmic moments like this always made me feel for the power of randomness beyond the algorithm. who knows, maybe the algorithm knew that i too was a hot dog lover and crafted my feed to bring these two narrative pieces together just for me. or maybe in a beautiful twist of fate, this algorithmic moment was just meant for me.</p>
